    <h1>Barbacoa</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This barbacoa recipe is simple to make in your slow cooker, 
        and makes the most tender, flavorful, delicious barbacoa beef.</p>
        <br>
    <img src="../images/Barbacoa.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>Traditionally, barbacoa is cooked over an open fire, or in a pit dug in 
       the ground that has been covered with maguey leaves. But I live in a loft 
       building downtown where open fires and pits are, you might say, “frowned 
       upon”. So I go for the next best thing — my slow cooker.</p>
    <p>To keep things as easy as possible, this recipe basically just requires 
        you to toss all of your ingredients in the pot and let the slow cooker do 
        all of the work. It will definitely yield a shredded beef barbacoa that 
        has a few chunks of onion and garlic and green chiles in there, which I 
        don't mind. But if you want to take an extra step, you can pulse all of 
        the extra non-beef ingredients (minus the bay leaves) together in a food 
        processor or blender beforehand so that there are no chunks. Your call.</p>

        <br>
        <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <br>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <br>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano (or standard dried oregano)</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper</li>
        <br>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <br>
        <li>1/2 cup beef stock or water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Slow cook.</strong>Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a 
            slow cooker. Toss gently to combine. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 
            hours, or on high for 3-4 hours, or until the beef is tender and 
            falls apart easily when shredded with a fork.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Shred and toss.</strong>Using two forks, shred the beef into 
            bite-sized pieces inside of the slow cooker. Toss the beef with the 
            juices, then cover and let the barbacoa beef soak up the juices for 
            an extra 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaves.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve.</strong>Use a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon to 
            serve the barbacoa beef and enjoy!
        </li>
